### Season Changer

Season Changer is a mini project built on the JavaFX GUI platform that demonstrates interactive UI design, styling, and simple animations. I developed it as a personal hobby project to deepen my understanding of JavaFX using Apache NetBeans and Gluon Scene Builder.

### 🌟 Features

One-Click Season Switch: Toggle between Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter themes instantly.

Custom Layouts: Explore JavaFX layout containers like BorderPane, VBox, and HBox.

CSS Styling: Apply external CSS to style backgrounds, buttons, and text.

Simple Animations: Add fade and transition effects to bring each season to life.
